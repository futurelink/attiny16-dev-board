## Small ATTiny1616/3216 development board with built-in RS-485/USB

---
This board was designed to work with new AVR chips that were based on good old architecture.
These chips have one undisputable feature - they are in tiny packages (VQFN-20 is 4x4mm) 
and they are extremely cheap but can run at 20MHz and have a full bunch of peripheral inside.

I also placed MAX3485 to support RS-485 line which can be switched back to CH340G to connect it
via USB (or even both can be disconnected if not needed).
